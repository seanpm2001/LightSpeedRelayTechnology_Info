# LRT

LSRT (Light Speed Relay Technology(ies))

Finally found a name after a week of random thought

I have been toying with this concept for a couple years now, in the past week, I have been thinking about it a lot, and I am now ready to bring it to the world.

# iDNS

isDNS/iDNS (InterStellar Domain Name System)

Very important component

## Purpose

Indexing content on planets/objects/space stations that you are receiving data from, then you can choose which one to connect to

EG: 

Note: these times are all made up, except for the moon, that is how long it takes to go from the Earth to its moon at light speed

"""
International Space Station (Earth) - - - ETA: 119 milliseconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Moon (Earth) - - - ETA: 1.3 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Option 2 (Mars) - - - ETA: 4 minutes 5.0 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Space Ship v848s7eusjsjd8vejs7nejri - - - ETA: 4 minutes 35.181 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]
"""

These inter range connections should be stored on a database at least 0.2 light seconds from the user, it shouldn't take longer than 1 second total. Copies of the database should be updated and refreshed automatically at least once per hour

# Database

## SQL extensions

### PostGreSQL

A database extension for light speed technologies, written in PostGreSQL (merge with PLpgSQL?)

### tSQL

A database extension for light speed technologies, written in tSQL (Transact SQL)

### PLpgSQL

A database extension for light speed technologies, written in PLpgSQL (Procedural Language/PostGreSQL)

***

# Database format

## Planets

## Spaceships

## Other objects

## Connection time

## Object IDs

## Refresh status

***

# Terms

This technology depends on terms of light speed travel.

LightSecond

LightMinute

LightHour

LightDay

LightWeek

LightMonth

LightYear

**Reminder:** These units of measurement are not to be confused with a measurement of time. However, the amount of distance unofficially works as both a measurement of time, speed, and distance.

# Repositories

LightSpeedRelayTechnologies_Info

LightSpeedRelay_Chat (IRC for LRT)

LightSpeedRelay_Database

LightSpeedRelay_WaitingScreen (A waiting screen for while you are connecting to a server)

LightSpeedRelay_DatabaseTools (Tools for LSRT databases)

# Current problems

No databases exist on other planets/orbiting/galactic objects yet.

For very high memory tasks through a web browser, such as web browser games, web browser virtual machines, depending on the distance, there will be a very noticeable delay. A possible strategy is to load 10 seconds worth of content every second, while it is sending, there is less delay. I am still unsure if this will work.

Data currently doesn't travel at the speed of light, and the times may be inconsistent. Recalculation is needed in some areas
